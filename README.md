# Smile-Detector
Python program that uses cv2 to detect smiles from images and webcam

This is an AI that, after recieving an image of a face, detects whether or not the face pictured in the photo is smiling
The database used to train and test the generated haarcascadeis made of images from another smile detection project off kaggle, and a colection of other images. 
The smile detection programs' database images can be found here:

The custom smile haarcascade xml was made with the help of a cascade trainer GUI.
This project made reference to a youtube livesream by Clever Programmer, which can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLY5JSE5WAU

# Program use

If the generated AI is having a hard time reading the face, ensure the face is in a bright area, and no parts are blocked from view. 

To display the detected image(s) the program will open a tab. To escape these tabs, press ESCAPE and alternatively for photo analysis click the X.
